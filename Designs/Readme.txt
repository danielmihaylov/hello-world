There are 3 files with design:
1.Main Grid is the initial one:
- Where we have right side bar with input for filtering companies 
by "name" for example it filter as you start typing, above the input 
we have a counter where we show how many companies we have shown.
- On the right side we have a grid which is sortable from the headers,
each row is expandable, where we have 2 more clickable headers: (statistics and history),
each of them will show different content

2.Statistics Grid is when you click on Statistics header:
- Here you will see a visualisation in percentages

3.History Grid is when you clicl on History header:
- Here you will see a graphical representation
